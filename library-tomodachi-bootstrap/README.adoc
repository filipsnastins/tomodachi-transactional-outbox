= library-tomodachi-bootstrap

Helper library that provides common functionality for bootstrapping https://github.com/kalaspuff/tomodachi[tomodachi] services

== Features

* Service configuration from environment variables with https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/usage/pydantic_settings/[Pydantic-Settings]
* https://www.structlog.org[structlog] logging middleware
* Correlation ID middleware
* Tomodachi base service class

== Usage

* Create your tomodachi service by inheriting from the `TomodachiServiceBase` class

```python
from tomodachi_bootstrap import TomodachiServiceBase


class TomodachiService(TomodachiServiceBase):
    name = "service-example"
```

* Extend base `Pydantic-Settings` configuration class with your own configuration class

```python
from functools import lru_cache

from tomodachi_bootstrap import TomodachiBaseSettings


class Settings(TomodachiBaseSettings):
    dynamodb_orders_table_name: str
    dynamodb_inbox_table_name: str
    dynamodb_outbox_table_name: str


@lru_cache
def get_settings() -> Settings:
    return Settings()  # type: ignore
```

* `TomodachiServiceBase` base configures structlog logger.

```python
import structlog


logger: structlog.stdlib.BoundLogger = structlog.get_logger()

logger.info("Hello, World!", foo="bar")
```

== Development

* Install dev dependencies with https://python-poetry.org[Poetry]

```bash
poetry install
poetry shell
pre-commit install
```
