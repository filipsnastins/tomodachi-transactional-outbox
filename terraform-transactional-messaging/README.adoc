Terraform module for `Idempotent Consumer` and `Transactional Outbox with DynamoDB Streams + Lambda` deployment to AWS.

[WARNING]
====
The Terraform definitions in this repository are for demo purposes only,
and must not be used for production deployments.
The IaC code omits many security practices for brevity and simplicity,
and most of the `tfsec` errors are ignored.
====

== Usage

=== Idempotent Consumer

Deploying DynamoDB `Inbox` table.

```terraform
module "service_orders_inbox_table" {
  source = "./idempotent-consumer-dynamodb-inbox"

  environment  = "test"
  service_name = "orders"
}
```

=== Transactional Outbox with DynamoDB Streams + Lambda

Deploying `Outbox` DynamoDB table, Lambda message relay, creating SNS topics and configuring IAM permissions.
Failed messages are saved to SQS dead-letter queue.

```terraform
module "service_orders_outbox_dynamodb_streams" {
  source = "outbox-dynamodb-streams"

  environment  = "test"
  service_name = "orders"

  create_sns_topics = [
    "order--approved",
    "order--cancelled",
    "order--created",
    "order--rejected",
  ]
}
```

== Development

```bash
brew install tfenv
brew install tflint
brew install tfsec

tfenv install

tflint
tfsec --config-file .tfsec.yml
